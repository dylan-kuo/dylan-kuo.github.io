### Seattle Data Guy (Ben Rogojan)
{% include elements/video.html id="SpaFPPByOhM" %}
Seattle data guy is definitely the most productive part-time youtuber (He was an ex-Amazon, ex-Facebook and is a data engineering/science consultant)! He's been generating high quality videos around data engineering consistently not only talking about the truth of data engineer career, roadmap, but also the skills and the latest toolings that you won't feel like falling behind the new tech stack (or the modern tech stack) if you are consistently waching his video. At least you'll get the sense of what the tool is and know the trend.

He also has a [news letter](https://seattledataguy.substack.com/) that talks about more on the data strategy for the startup company which I think it will be helpful to shape your mindset with a broader perspective.
