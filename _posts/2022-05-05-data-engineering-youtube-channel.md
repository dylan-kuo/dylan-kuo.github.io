## Seattle Data Guy (Ben Rogojan)

{% include elements/video.html id="SpaFPPByOhM" %}

[Seattle data guy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminrogojan/) is definitely the most productive part-time youtuber (He was an ex-Amazon, ex-Facebook and is a data engineering/science consultant). He's been generating high quality videos around data engineering consistently not only talking about the truth of data engineer career, roadmap, but also the skills and the latest toolings that you won't feel like falling behind the new tech stack (or [the modern tech stack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ClWgwC0Sbw)) if you are consistently waching his video. At least you'll get the sense of what the tool is and know the trend.

He also has a [Newsletter](https://seattledataguy.substack.com/) that talks about more on the data strategy for the startup company which I think it will be helpful to shape your mindset with a broader perspective.


## Zach Wilson

[Zach Wilson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eczachly/) is my all time favorite! He's absolutely a superstar in the data engineering world! He has a fantastic background (ex-Facebook, ex-Netflix, and now a tech lead at Airbnb). From his [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/DatawithZach/featured) and many [interviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWVindWhIX8&list=PLu3aHfPR4Pynlsoku-MONgOqfxG3ReV2K&index=5) he shared lot's of career advises, roadmaps, basic and advanced skills, tools, technical interviews, and mental health. 

He used to be a software enginner and data engineer at Netflix and he shares a lot of inisghts about the distributed data pipeline in both software engineering and data engineering's perspectives that always makes me excited to listen.

He post a lot on his [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eczachly/) around data engineering and the mental health. Definitely check it out and follow him.


## Andreas Kretz

[Andreas Kretz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreas-kretz/) is the [OG data engineering youtuber](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY8mzqqGwl5_bTpBY9qLMAA) for sure! The video above is the one that got me intrigued in the data engineering world two yeas ago and that's the reason why I made a decision to become a data engineer. 

He's pretty good at explaining the complex data pipeline in simple words. His [data engineering cookbook](https://github.com/andkret/Cookbook) was written two years ago and it's still worth taking a look. He is a full-time data engineering coach and provides many [courses & coaching](https://learndataengineering.com/).
